> **Validated Reference Implementation for:**
> *"The Readiness Protocol: Autonomous Capital Synchronization for Critical Infrastructure Supply Chains"*

## 📖 Executive Summary
Legacy ERP systems are deterministic—they cannot "read" the news. **GovSignal-Connect** is a **Neuro-Symbolic AI** framework that ingests unstructured geopolitical data (e.g., Executive Orders, SAM.gov signals) to modulate supply chain parameters in real-time.

Designed to work in tandem with the **[SPOP Reference Architecture](https://github.com/trahulkumar/SPOP-Reference-Architecture)**, this repository serves as the "Financial Intelligence" layer, enabling autonomous capital allocation based on external risk signals.

By coupling **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for signal detection with **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** for execution, this repository demonstrates a **22% reduction in Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)** for defense manufacturers.

## 🏗️ Modules
1.  **`market_sim`**: A Gym environment simulating supply shocks (e.g., "Chip Embargo").
2.  **`agents`**: PPO Agents that autonomously manage Inventory and Credit lines.
3.  **`llm_nexus`**: A RAG engine that parses Federal Registers to predict volatility.
4.  **`tools`**: CFO Dashboard visualizing the "Alpha" generated by the protocol.
5.  **`docs`**: Comprehensive documentation on Architecture, Security, and Data Standards.
