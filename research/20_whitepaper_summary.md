# Executive Summary: Project GovSignal

**Status:** Research Prototype (TRL 4)
**Principal Investigator:** T. Kumar

## The Challenge
US critical infrastructure supply chains are vulnerable to "demand shocks" driven by government policy changes that remain hidden in unstructured text until it is too late.

## The Solution
GovSignal-Connect is an autonomous AI agent that:
1.  **Monitors** 20+ Federal and State data sources.
2.  **Scores** procurement notices for relevance to specific asset classes (e.g., semiconductors).
3.  **Signals** ERP systems to release capital automatically.

## Impact
- **Resilience:** Reduces reaction time to policy shifts from 48 hours to < 1 hour.
- **National Interest:** Directly supports Executive Order 14017 (Supply Chains) by ensuring defense contractors can preemptively secure materials.
