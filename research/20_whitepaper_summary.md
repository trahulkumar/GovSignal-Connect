# Executive Summary: The Readiness Protocol

**Status:** Research Prototype (TRL 4 - Validated via Monte Carlo Simulation)
**Principal Investigator:** T. Kumar

## The Challenge
US critical infrastructure supply chains face a "Capital-Efficiency Gap." Legacy ERPs are reactive, creating a 12-18 month "Inventory Lag" during geopolitical demand shocks (e.g., semiconductor tool shortages).

## The Solution
GovSignal-Connect is the reference implementation of the "Smart Overlay" architecture. It:
1.  **Monitors** federal/state data for demand signals.
2.  **Calculates** a "Resilience Premium" to justify pre-emptive spending.
3.  **Signals** ERPs to release capital *before* shortages occur.

## Key Findings (2026 Simulation)
- **Lead Time:** Reduced by **75%** (12 months $\to$ 3 months) for critical defense assets.
- **Resilience Premium:** Identified an **$800k Criticality Threshold** where pre-emptive readiness becomes mathematically superior to "Just-in-Time" efficiency.
- **Impact:** Directly operationalizes **Executive Order 14017** by preventing "Black Swan" stockouts in the Defense Industrial Base.
