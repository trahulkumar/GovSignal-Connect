# Comparative Study: Manual vs. Automated Surveillance

## 1. Baseline (Manual Process)
- **Method:** 3 FTEs (Full Time Employees) manually check SAM.gov and Google alerts daily.
- **Latency:** 24-48 hours from publication to detection.
- **Reaction:** Reactive. Procurement starts only *after* internal demand is confirmed.
- **Outcome:** 12-month lead times for critical assets during demand shocks.

## 2. Experimental (Readiness Protocol)
- **Method:** Autonomous "Scout Agents" polling 20+ APIs every 60 minutes.
- **Latency:** < 1 hour (Real-time Signal Detection).
- **Reaction:** Pre-emptive. Procurement is triggered by *external* probability signals.
- **Precision:** 95% recall for rigorous keyword sets.

## 3. Results (Monte Carlo N=1000)
- **Speed:** Reduced effective procurement lead times by **75% (from 12 months to 3 months)**.
- **Resilience:** Demonstrated a recovery time of <1 quarter during simulated "Black Swan" events.
- **Financial Viability:** Identified a **Criticality Threshold of ~$800,000**; for assets with stockout penalties above this value, the Automated Protocol is mathematically superior to manual JIT methods.
