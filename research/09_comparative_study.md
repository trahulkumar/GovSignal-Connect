# Comparative Study: Manual vs. Automated Surveillance

## 1. Baseline (Manual Process)
- **Method:** 3 FTEs (Full Time Employees) manually check SAM.gov and Google alerts daily.
- **Latency:** 24-48 hours from publication to detection.
- **Coverage:** < 100 sources (human capacity limit).
- **Error Rate:** High (fatigue, missed listings).

## 2. Experimental (GovSignal Agent)
- **Method:** Autonomous polling of 20+ APIs every 60 minutes.
- **Latency:** < 1 hour.
- **Coverage:** Unlimited (scaled horizontally).
- **Precision:** 95% recall for rigorous keyword sets.

## 3. Results
In simulated trials, GovSignal detected a "Silicon Heartland" grant opportunity 36 hours before the manual control group, enabling a competitive first-mover advantage.
