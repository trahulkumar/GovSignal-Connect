# Research Problem Statement: Automated Supply Chain Signal Surveillance

## 1. Introduction
The global supply chain for critical technologies (semiconductors, aerospace, defense systems) is increasingly fragmented. Traditional "Just-in-Time" (JIT) manufacturing models have failed to account for geopolitical disruptions, leading to capital lock-up in inventory that cannot be completed due to missing components.

## 2. Core Problem
Current ERP systems (SAP, Oracle) are reactive. They manage internal inventory but lack "peripheral vision"—the ability to detect external distress signals (e.g., a grant for a supplier's competitor, a regulatory fine, or a sudden policy shift) before a disruption occurs.

## 3. Objective
This research proposes **GovSignal-Connect**, an autonomous agent system that monitors unstructured government data (SAM.gov, Federal Register, State Economic Development boards) to predict supply chain demand shifts and automate capital allocation decisions.
