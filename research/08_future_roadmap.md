# Future Research Roadmap

## Phase 2: Semantic Intelligence (Q3 2026)
- **High-Dimensional Index:** Implement Vector Database (Pinecone/Milvus) to store semantic embeddings of Federal Register documents.
- **Context-Aware Retrieval:** Replace KDA with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to differentiate between "Computer Chips" and "Potato Chips."

## Phase 3: Autonomous Contract Negotiations (Q1 2027)
- **Automated Proposal Generation:** An agent that cross-references RFPs against internal inventory to draft compliant responses (Far Part 15).
- **Escrow Smart Contracts:** Utilization of Permissioned Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for automated vendor payments upon milestone verification.

## Phase 4: National Deployment & Sovereignty
- **FedRAMP High Authorization:** Hardening the platform for storage of CUI/ITAR data.
- **Inter-Agency Interoperability:** Creating a data mesh to cross-correlate demand signals between the DoD (Defense) and DoE (Energy).
